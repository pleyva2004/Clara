Hello NJIT SHPE!
My name is Tony Vaccarino and I am the Early Talent Programs Director for PGIM Fixed Income. PGIM is the global investment management arm of Prudential Financial and weâ€™re headquartered in Newark, NJ right across the street! Before joining Fixed Income I worked in Prudentialâ€™s Human Resources Campus Recruiting team. Fixed Income is our largest marquee PGIM business and we hire for 5 diverse programs across investments, operations, and technology (Internship & Entry Level). I am partnering with several talent ambassadors internally on recruiting efforts for NJIT which is 1 of our key target schools year over year!
We came across your organization on the student clubs directory and thought it could be a great fit for our specific firm/industry. We have several organization on campus that we partner with year over year but weâ€™re always looking to expand our network and share our opportunities with additional organizations. Please let us know if thereâ€™s an opportunity for us to include your organization when we start planning for in person info sessions and events which typically take place in September and October. We post our 2026 early talent roles on July 15th which is just around the corner, so weâ€™ll definitely share flyers and more information with you after our jobs are live; would love if youâ€™re able to cascade everything out to your organization as well ðŸ˜Š.
Attaching more high level information on our programs and hoping we can stay in touch moving forward. If you have any questions or any more information on your organization please share with us. Iâ€™m emailing the general mailbox today but if thereâ€™s a better email/contact we should be engaging in the future please let us know. Hoping we can find facetime with your students when weâ€™re in the thick of recruiting this fall and Iâ€™ll definitely stay in touch when we start planning for our events/engagement.
Thx so much and I look forward to hearing back from you!
